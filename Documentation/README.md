# Documentation
The documentation for this software project is written as a [typst document](https://typst.app/). In order to save some time the [template](https://github.com/DannySeidel/typst-dhbw-template) of [Danny Seidel](https://github.com/DannySeidel) was used and modified. If you merely want to see the documentation as a PDF, use the "main.pdf" file.

# Export PDF
Exporting the PDF can be done inside the `documentation` folder with the command:

```console 
typst compile main.typ
```
